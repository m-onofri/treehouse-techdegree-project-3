# Third project of PHP treehouse Techdegree: "Build a Personal Learning Journal"
Create a web application using PHP Data Objects (PDO) and a SQLite database. The web application, a personal learning journal, lets a user add and edit journal entries and store the results in a database. The result is a useful, blog-like web application. 

# Database
I used a SQLite database that contains three tables:

 - entries (id, title, date, time_spent, learned, resources)
 - tags (id, name)
 - entries_tags (entries_id, tags_id)
